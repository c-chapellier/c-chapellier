### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a C library to easily modify const variables.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to bypass compilers warnings.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the Linux kernel to implement this library.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Stack Overflow.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything [here](https://www.google.com "Just click").
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have a Github account, you can find me [here](https://github.com/c-chapellier "Google's Homepage").
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Itself.
- âš¡ Fun fact: This fact is true.

```c
#include <stdio>

#define PASSWORD root

int main(int argc; char *argv[])
{
	const char *string = malloc(sizeof char *);

	string = "Hello World !";

	there:for (const unsigned int i = -1; i < argc; i++)
	{
		printf('%d', string[i]);
		++i;
	}

	if (PASSWORD == argv[argc])
	{
		printf(""); // doesn't work without it
		goto there;
	}

	printf("all good\n");	

	return (0);
}
```
